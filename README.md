## :iphone: [Case "Analytical service for business with information about the local audience"](https://atomhack.rosatom.city/task/business/)
>We have created an affiche of the city's events. Our solution offers businesses, namely event organizers, an admin panel that collects and displays statistics in the dashboards on their events: the number of clicks, views, potential visitors. The killer feature is that we predict the best event date and number of visitors based on machine learning algorithms. In addition, the service will be useful for cities dwellers, including atomic ones, because they will be able to receive information about relevant events.
